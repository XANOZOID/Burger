# Burger : Burgerlang

This is a scripting language. It was pretty much designed for me, but if you like it - great!

Reason I say it's designed for me is because there's a lot to not like about it (unless you're like me, where all of these are pluses):
1. It was influenced heavily by my experience working with a severely limited language known as GML (from the old days)
2. It's entirely procedural 
3. There are no first class functions or "classes with methods"
4. Anything that does require dynamic-ish behavior is done through events which are not like scripts and have no returns
    a. Events are defined statically too.
5. It looks like JavaScript and Go had a baby
